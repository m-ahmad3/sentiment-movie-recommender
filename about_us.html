        FlixGo: Where Meaning Meets Movies
        At FlixGo, we believe movies are more than genres and ratings—they’re emotional journeys, intellectual adventures, and mirrors of the human experience. Born from a love of cinema and cutting-edge AI, we’ve built a recommendation engine that goes beyond the surface to understand why a story resonates with you.
        
        Our Mission
        To connect you with films that align with your emotional pulse and intellectual curiosity. Whether you’re searching for a movie about fractured identities, existential humor, or quiet rebellion, FlixGo decodes the DNA of storytelling to find your perfect match.
        
        How We Do It
        Powered by semantic AI and natural language processing, FlixGo analyzes:
        
        Themes: Loss, ambition, freedom, or the absurdity of modern life.
        
        Narrative Nuances: Unreliable narrators, nonlinear plots, poetic dialogue.
        
        Cultural Layers: Films that challenge norms or celebrate heritage.
